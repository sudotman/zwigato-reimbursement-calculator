# Reimbursement Calculator
A simple tool to allow easy calculation of reimbursement each month without having to rely on manual entry of values from screenshots/bills. Works with Swiggy/Zomato/Blinkit/Zepto screenshots/bills out of the gate.

## Purpose
A lot of corporate offices have a reimbursement policy where you can reimburse expenditure throughout the month during office hours. This entails a lot of time of manually sifting through screenshots, filling forms and converting to PDF. This tool reads through your screeshots/photos, calculates the total amount, converts the images into the PDF (even names them according to the previous month's name using your computer's date and time), and saves the total amount to a text file too.
